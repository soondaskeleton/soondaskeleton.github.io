Ignition coil replacement 6. I took big red to the shop since there seemed to be a jerk when pressing on the accelerator. Eventually, the jerk included a vigorous rough shaking when parked or while applied on brakes. I took big red to see my auto dealer and had the car diagnosed for its behavior. Ahahahaha. It's not human but it's treated like my baby unisex. Somedays the vehicle is a male and somedays it rules the universe as a female. You know, mother nature has its ways.
