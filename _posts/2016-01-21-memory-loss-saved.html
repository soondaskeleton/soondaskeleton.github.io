title: "Memory Lane for the Night"

Why I(You pig-headed brain)?! 
I had a stubborn brain which got me in trouble in the rain. I ended up having a frightful night and wished I had carried a small night light. I won't get anywhere with a stiff heart nor with a willful brain. I walked in the pouring rain and thought I'm 100% confident to find my lost car.

Hell with that! 

I was 100% incompetent to lost and found my car since I assumed I parked on Juniper St. You know what that means! I'm an ass! Yeah. I am because I assumed. Fudge chocolate slices! I'm an ass to assumed. My last memory lane recall was Juniper Street on a slanted street, $3 small parking lot, and one way entrance/exit. 

Cry me a river... I walked and ran as if I was hunting for my next meal but I was a haunted clawless bear holding onto an umbrella as if it's my barton stick to scare off any goons. I reached 5+ miles walking aimlessly in the cold rain. I burned enough cardio and fat. Ahahaha if you looked at me, you might ask "what fat? Have you looked at yourself? You're crazy!" I knew I parked in a $3 parking lot and on a slanted hill up on a street. In addition to this $3 parking lot there is only one entrance and exit lane. Hell with hills. And hell with loss memory. 

 The night was bold and young while it was cold and wrong. In the end of the night, the last known street address was not Juniper Street instead it was located on Spring Street. I was a nut, a crazy squirrel in search for her next meal. Eh, let's stick with haunted bear hunting for food. I ended up having a minor frostbite on my right hand and wrist. I took myself to see a friendly medic and soon I received some love, scorn, and a great deal of teases. Memory lane has been recounted and I've recollected my composure to make notes next time. Hmm. Maybe there won't be a next time therefore take a selfie and photo of where I parked. Ooooo invest in a locate-car-app.
