I took a drive down town to Virgina Highlands to meet my niece. Ahahahaha my niece is a cat. I see kids all day and so the kids at work are my cutie kids and when I go visit friends who have kids. They're my godkids. I guess, you can say those kids are my cutie kids too. You can't have enough of cutie kids. You'll see them almost everywhere.
