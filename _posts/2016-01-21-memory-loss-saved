memo: Stubborn brain won't get me anywhere. I walked in the pouring rain for 2 hours, for what.. The last resort was to call my friend at the end of the night. The last known street address was a pain. In the end, the last known street address was not where I parked my vehicle. I'm so grateful I can call you when I need you JLYK. We backtracked where I turned and discovered that I parked off Spring St. and not Juniper St. I roamed the city of Atlanta nightlife in this freaking cold weather in search of memory. I think about 6 miles of walk and jog from one street to another. I didn't need any more cardio but I extended my cardio for the week. Does that count? Can I do all my cardio in one day and still get the same results? Ahahaha. booo. I was a nut, a crazy squirrel. I ended up having a weather cold injuries on my right hand and wrist. The build up tension from the cold air and wetness resulted in frostbite. In the mean time, I'm healing from tonight's memory loss, .
