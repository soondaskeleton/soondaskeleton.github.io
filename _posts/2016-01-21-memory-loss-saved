Why I(You pig-headed brain)?! 
I had a stubborn brain which got me in trouble in the rain. I ended up having a frightful night and wished I had carried a night light. I won't get anywhere with a stiff heart nor with a willful brain. I walked in the pouring rain and thought I'm 100% confident to find my lost car.

Hell with that! 

I was 100% incompetent to lost and found my car since I assumed I parked on Juniper St. You know what that means! I'm an ass! Yeah. I am because I assumed. Fudge chocolate slices! I'm an ass in thinking I parked on Juniper St. What I recall last on memory lane was Juniper St, a slanted street, $3 small parking lot, and one way entrance and exit. 

Cry me a river... I walked and ran like a haunted clawless bear holding onto an umbrella like it's my barton stick to scare off any goons. I reached 5+ miles walking aimlessly in the cold rain. I burned enough cardio and leg lifts. I knew I parked in a $3 parking lot and on a slanted hill with one entrance and exit lane. Hell with hills.

 The night was bold and young while it was cold and wrong for me. In the end, the last known street address was not Juniper St. instead it was located on Spring St. I was a nut, a crazy squirrel in search of her next meal. I ended up having a minor frostbite on my right hand and wrist. I took myself to see a friendly medic and soon I received some love, scorn, and a great deal of teases. Memory lane has been recounted and I've recolledcted my composure to make notes next time.
